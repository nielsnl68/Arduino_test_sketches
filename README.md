# Arduino_test_sketches
In this reposatory i will place all kind of sketches i made to test different systems.
it could be useful for others, or not.

## chainable_object_test
 the following sketch is a proto of a chainable class system.  
 with on function in the Impl class you can hook that class   
 to his predecessor class.    
 This system will be used to create a new I2S library where    
 you can link (chain) different proccesses together to receive  
 sound from different sources decode/encode them end send the  
 result out again.  
 This example shows also a way to interact with each other with  
 the use of an interface class.  

## esp32-nowspeed test
 this sketch is build around the TTGO esp32 T-display it shows how many package can be send of the ESP-NOW protocol between 2 defices.
 Just start both and they will find each other end start sending full sized packages to each other.
